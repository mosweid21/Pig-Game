# Pig Game

## Description
"Pig Game" is a fun and engaging two-player dice game where each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they dare to accumulate points. But beware! Roll a '1', and you'll lose all points gained during that turn. The game promotes risk management and strategic thinking, making it an exciting challenge.

## How to Play
- **Starting the Game:** Each player begins with a score of 0. On your turn, roll the dice to add points to your current score.
- **Rules:**
  1. On your turn, you can roll the dice as many times as you want. Each result adds to your current score.
  2. But, if you roll a '1', you lose all points accumulated in that turn, and your turn ends.
  3. You can choose to 'Hold', which means your current score is added to your global score, and your turn ends.
  4. The first player to reach 100 points on global score wins the game.
